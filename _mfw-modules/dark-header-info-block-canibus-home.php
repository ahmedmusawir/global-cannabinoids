							<p>All of our bulk and wholesale American grown phytocannabinoid rich (PCR) hemp CBD products are tested, packaged, and processed in the great States of Colorado, Oregon, and North Carolina, USA.</p> 

							<p>All finished products are manufactured using GMP or ISO certified processes. We are the largest bulk distributors of organic, domestic, medicinal hemp CBD oil in North America.</p> 

							<p>Our unique and proprietary strains of high CBD / low THC cannabis hemp produces naturally more beneficial cannabinoids and terpenes than any landrace or hemp strain found in European or Chinese industrial hemp! </p>

							<p>While everyone else was cross-breeding strains of cannabis to produce more THC, our genetics team was creating cannabis strains to produce less THC (even to zero), and greater amounts of more non-psychotropic cannabinoids such as CBD, CBC, CBG, and CBN. </p>

							<p>Because our proprietary strain genetics produce naturally less than .3% THC, we are able to register them with the State Departments of Agriculture in Colorado, Oregon, and North Carolina as "industrial hemp". </p>

							<p>Our farming partners were issued some of the first hemp licenses in the USA in 2014. All of our American hemp CBD plants are grown and distributed in full compliance with the Departments of Agriculture in Oregon, Colorado, and North Carolina, as well in full federal compliance with ยง7606 of the 2014 US Farm Bill and can be sold in nearly all states.</p>
