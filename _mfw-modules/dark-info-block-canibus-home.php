								<li>Complete Whole Plant, Full Flower Profile - Our proprietary extraction process uses the entire plant for a full-spectrum oil, containing a large amount of naturally present cannabinoids such as CBG, CBN, CBC, THCA, CBDA, and over 60 terpenes we have identified that are naturally present in our extract. </li>

								<li>Extraction & Purification Process - We use the latest extraction technology which allows for high levels of cannabinoids especially CBD, CBG, CBC, and CBN, while eliminating unwanted amounts of THC and chlorophyll. </li>

								<li>Rigorous Testing - On-site chromatography testing ensures accurate levels of phytocannabinoids and confirms the absence of THC through our proprietary processes. </li>

								<li>3rd Party Lab Testing - All batches we produce are sent to one of our authorized 3rd Party Labs for complete analysis and verification of the internal lab test results that we conduct in-house and include with all orders. </li>
